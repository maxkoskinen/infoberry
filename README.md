# Infoberry

This project turns Raspberry Pis into simple digital signage devices that can display web pages.

## What's This About?

Infoberry transforms Raspberry Pis (or really any device that can run Chromium) into display machines. Show off web pages, images, videos, or whatever you want on screens around your home, office, or tech cave.

It‚Äôs made up of two parts:

### üçì Client

The client runs on your Raspberry Pi and handles all the heavy lifting:

- **Displays stuff in kiosk mode** - Full-screen Chromium with no distractions
- **Rotates through your content** - URLs, images, videos, local HTML files‚Äîyou name it
- **Auto-reloads** - Set refresh intervals so your content stays fresh
- **Hot-reloads config** - Edit your YAML config file and watch it update live
- **Screen rotation support** - Because sometimes monitors are mounted weird



### üñ•Ô∏è Server (Coming Soon‚Ñ¢)

The server will eventually let you manage all your displays from one place. For now, we're keeping it simple with file-based configs. The old server got the axe during a refactor/rewrite 

## Quick Start
